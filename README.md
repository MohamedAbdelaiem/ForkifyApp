## 📚 Project Journey

Developing the Forkify App was an in-depth learning experience as part of the comprehensive JavaScript course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). This project was a culmination of several weeks of hard work, during which I delved deep into advanced JavaScript concepts, mastered OOP design, and honed my skills in modern web development.

### Key Learning Points:

- **OOP in Practice:** Applied OOP principles extensively, creating classes and methods that enhanced code reusability and readability.
- **API Integration:** Learned how to fetch and manipulate data from a third-party API (Forkify API), and handle asynchronous operations effectively.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Employed various data structures and DOM manipulation algorithms to manage the app's dynamic content and improve performance.
- **Responsive UI Design:** Built a user-friendly interface that works smoothly across devices, ensuring a great user experience.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **🔍 Search for Recipes:** Use the search bar to find recipes by entering keywords like "pasta," "chicken," or "dessert."
2. **👀 View Recipe Details:** Click on any recipe from the search results to open a detailed view. You'll see the list of ingredients, preparation instructions, and nutritional info.
3. **🔄 Adjust Servings:** Modify the number of servings by using the plus/minus buttons, and watch as the ingredient quantities automatically update.
4. **💾 Bookmark Recipes:** Save recipes by clicking the bookmark icon. Access your bookmarked recipes anytime from the bookmark section.
5. **📝 Add Your Recipe:** Submit your own recipes by filling out the form in the 'Add Recipe' section. Share your culinary creations with the world!
